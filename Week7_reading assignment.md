**Write a one-paragraph reaction to the book chapter and chosen section (Iran, Egypt, or Japan), and come up with one or two questions for the authors. Be prepared to talk about your reaction next week.**
	
I really like the concept of participatory culture in that it involves scholarly collaboration and advocacy for erased communities with the purpose of documenting and disseminating information for humankind. I related to the point concerning the amplification of misinformation via social media because I see very questionable tweets and infographics around Twitter that spread like wildfire, with the most recent case being the #helpsai tweets that blew up last week where a girl posted an SOS call to the internet which later was found to be fake. The exposure allowed her to gain a large sum of money via GoFund Me. As for the crisis in Egypt, I thought it was especially interesting that although Twitter users were publicized as instigating the revolution, it is actually the influence of the working class that made up the majority of the resistance. As for the second part of the readings, I found it really cool to see how sentiments could be visualized/mapped in a temporal sense! Especially so when the sentiments ebb and flow with the events that continued to unfold in the aftermath of the incident. Lastly, I appreciate the normalization and scaling of the data so that “fear” and “weariness” were the predominant sentiments because the previous graphic could have been misleading.
