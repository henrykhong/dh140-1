&nbsp This article is about mapping unstructured clinical notes to new coding schemes in order to efficiently create a database to determine patient billing. This process is important because hospitals do not get paid unless they encode the bill correctly when it is sent to the insurance company. In the old code, or ICD-9, rules-based natural language processing (NLP) engines were employed to make connections. However, this process had many pitfalls. For example, the engine could not make the connection that “inflammation of the appendix” and “appendicitis” are the same thing. Additionally, humans had to manually input the rules and exceptions, which meant that the implementation of new rules took several months. However, in the new version, or ICD-10, an ontological-based NLP engine was employed, which automates many of the processes to form connections. Developers do not have to code new sets of rules but rather only need to change the knowledge base.  

This article highlights how I found this article interesting because it highlights how different approaches in coding can make a monumental difference in efficiency. It is quite amazing that the engine can form connections on its own with sufficient, high quality data. Additionally, this new approach may result in less biased classification, because humans are not manually inputting the rules anymore.  I think this article in particular spoke to me because it shows how powerful and interdisciplinary coding can be. If data science consists of substantive expertise, hacking skills, and math & statistics knowledge, this article highlights the importance of substantive expertise. Having a weak background in clinical knowledge could cause one to make faulty connections in the NLP engine.
