# Welcome to my DH140 Repository!

### Profile
- My name is Derek Wang, and I am third-year Statistics major at UCLA. I am pursuing a career related to data science and research, and am interested in music, art, and fashion.


### DH140 Course Description:
- Introduction to coding, with a focus on Python. 
- The study of basic structural elements such as lists, if statements, dictionaries, loops, functions, and classes
- Consideration of how to apply these concepts to research in humanities and social sciences, and project-based learning.
- Students discover how to manage and display data with added impact. 

### Project Ideas:
- How COVID-19 is impacting mental health, and how our forms of entertainment have transformed during quarantine.
- How COVID-19 is impacting different types of businesses (e.g. restaurants, grocery stores, gyms, salons, bars, etc).
- How music taste is constantly evolving, geographically and temporally in the U.S.
- How social media platforms (e.g. TikTok, Twitter, Instagram) may impact mental health.
- How social media algorithms (e.g. TikTok, Twitter, Instagram) can be racist/biased. 

### Objectives:
- My objectives in this course are to become adept at Python and GIS Mapping, and to create a substantial project to show and impress future employers. I hope to one day incorporate my data science skills into research at UCLA.
