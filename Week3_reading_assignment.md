I really liked how OpenStreetMaps's decision to provide open data for free rather than privatizing it. Since its foundation is built on the basis of volunteerism--the amount of data collected surpasses any amount a private company could've collected because of the sheer number of people willing to contribute for free. It would likely be very cost prohibitive to enlist the same amount of people across the globe in comparison to OpenStreetMaps. As such, OpenSourceMaps allows for the potential to enlist a global effort, which could explain its success. Another commendable point is how open data can be used by humanitarian organizations like The Red Cross to map "missing" communities. In the video, Rachel Levine explains how these areas are unmapped because there is no profit to be made in doing so. As such, humanitarian organizations step in with the intent to help these communities and map their surrounding areas to allow for better transportation infrastructure, mapping important water access points, and map local businesses.
